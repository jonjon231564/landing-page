Landing page project

Hello, stranger, I'm not too sure what im suppose to be doing with this other than making a habit of make these for github. The way I'm going to be structuring these is that I'll be starting off with a intro and then in the programs I will be making comments when I decide I need to be making a significant change in the program. These comments will be in the order of which I made them.

1. Starting off I'll be just making the barebones of the html program including the elements placed in which i can precieve myself making flexboxes along with the text content.

2. I'm really happy with how easily ive gone through this so far. The odin project is great because you get out what you put in. Im now moving on the css portion in which i will work in order of biggest flexboxes to the smallest.

3. actually now that i think about it I'll start with adjusting the text settings as far as italicizing bolding and font size

4. Finished! it was enjoyable but i will be looking forward towards streamlining the adjusting process.
